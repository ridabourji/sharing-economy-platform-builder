    [describe-your-idea] => Technical Clarification

Someone could be trying to understand a concept in a programming tutorial and/or forum but just can't picture or visualize that the forum/tutorial is trying to say. Technical Clarification would be a forum to use to ask other tech users questions on what a particular passage means. The goal is to create a safe space for those who might need to have a concept explained in a different way from what is currently being offered.
    [what-is-your-motivation-to-propose-that-idea] => I started developing an Operating System and found myself looking at the OSdev wiki for help. While many articles I understood, there were some that need to be clarified (such as Disk DMA support). I learned (the easy way, thankfully) to fear potential "Read the ******* Manual" like responses if I asked for clarification on the site itself so a platform like this would be a great alternative.

    [describe-your-idea] => Help people who do not have bank account receive money through neighbors who have a bank account.
    [what-is-your-motivation-to-propose-that-idea] => In Mexico, 60% families have at least one bank account, which means that there are 40% families do not have a bank account. So they have to spend the time to go to a bank to send money, and hard to receive money.

    [describe-your-idea] => This is a crowd market that focuses on providing tutors through an app. The crowd market connects people who need a tutor (students) with people who can offer assistance (tutors). This crowd market offers two main services: X, that are sessions from tutors who are also students with course knowledge and Y, that are provided from tutors who have a degree in the area(professional). The crowd market charges students a fee calculated by their platform once the service has ended. The Crowd market platform takes a percentage of every session income, and the rest goes to the tutor. The service is available on college campuses.

    [describe-your-idea] => This is a crowd market that focuses on sharing music equipment through an app. The crowd market connects people who need a piece of music equipment with people who are not using theirs and might want to make some extra money.

    [describe-your-idea] => This market would connect those who need the services of an artist with those artists. It could be anything from photography to a mural being done. All different types of artists could sign up for the sites and customers could literally shop for someone to do the artistic job they need done. So, couples could find photographers for weddings or new parents could find that perfect photographer to take pictures of their newborn.
    [what-is-your-motivation-to-propose-that-idea] => It seems like it would help more artists do what they love. It could help undiscovered talent be found. It would give people the opportunity to have one-of-kind/ unique products and experiences. It also seems like there is room in the market for something like this that focuses on creative needs.

    [describe-your-idea] => I envision a crowd market where people can exchange parking spot information with others.  As a person leaves a parking spot they can post it on a site and connect with others.  The person leaving can choose to wait until the person who wanted the spot arrives to help ensure they are the one that gets the spot.  By having early access to available parking places, people can save time.  There would be a membership fee in addition to a nominal charge each time the service is used.  The person providing the spot will also receive a token amount.  The fee varies by location, time, and demand/availability.
    [what-is-your-motivation-to-propose-that-idea] => I feel that this will be a good way for people to earn revenue and for others to save time.  Everyone hates trying to find a parking spot and this crowd market will benefit both parties as well as the service provider.

    [describe-your-idea] => Combine Uber with Redbox. You put up machines, much like Redbox, and those who subscribe to the service would pay something like $12 - $20 a year and would given a pin number that they could use at one of these boxes. Anyone who wanted to could "donate" a DVD or Blu-Ray. Those who aren't subscribers would be given a coupon for a free rental for each movie they donate. Those who are subscribers would be able to rent one movie at a time from any box, anywhere in the country. Basically, a Movie Library that could be placed on any street corner or in front of any store. Non-Subscribers would be allow to pay a small fee, similar to Redbox, in order to rent a DVD or Blu-Ray. Subscribers would be able to go online and reserve a movie while non-subscribers would not.
    [what-is-your-motivation-to-propose-that-idea] => My wife is a movie fanatic and has a very large DVD and Blu-Ray Collection. Since almost of the video stores have gone out of business, the only places to RENT a DVD or Blu-Ray anymore is Netflix, Amazon or Redbox. While Amazon and Netflix have a large selection, you have to PLAN for those. You have to order the movie DAYS in advance unless it's on streaming and Redbox, due to the size of their boxes, offers only so many selections and a lot of those slots are, justifiably, taken up by new movies. This idea would put older movies, or TV shows, out there for rental, or borrowing.

    [describe-your-idea] => A platform that connects people with others that need certain tasks done in a hurry would be nice. Someone using an app could request that someone goes and grabs some groceries and drops them off that is already in the area. Or maybe a runner could take my dog with them for a jog, or maybe someone could go and pick up my mother's medicine for her and drop it off and grab her mail and drop that in the box as they are doing there errands around town..and they agree on a fee beforehand..

    [advertisement01] => They would advertise online and at campuses across the country. The place could also become international as many academic experts exist in foreign countries.
    [tips01] => There would be a dedicated site for both workers and users and perhaps a test site using the platforms own "students' or hired individuals that could vet potential experts.
    [funding01] => I think the platform would essentially fund itself in the early stages. Perhaps workers would have to pay a yearly recurring fee to be able to advertise their services and have access to the platform.
    [guidance01] => I would enlist the help of entrepreneurial minds and not those that currently run such sites as they are poorly run.
    [indepth01] => The design and the division of subjects into highly specialized compartments. Instead of just "Mandarin" there could be subsets within the language subject like level, dialect and context of use, i.e. legal or literary language.

    [describe-your-idea] => I'd like to create a crowd marketplace that connects individuals with specific skill sets such as woodworking or basic household maintenance and upkeep with individuals looking to start a hobby or save money around the house. A do it yourself marketplace where the individual is taught in person by someone in their neighborhood or local community. The marketplace would be broken done into categories and subcategories of tasks. The buyers would pay a set fee based on the estimation of job length and difficulty. The platform itself would of course take a small percentage of each paid fee. The buyers would also rate the sellers or teachers after the interaction is complete. 
    [what-is-your-motivation-to-propose-that-idea] => People today severely lack many hands on household skills. Most folks can't change the oil in their vehicle and many don't even understand the need to change HVAC filters in their homes.
